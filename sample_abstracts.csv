Response disequilibrium theory suggests that a response deficit in a contingent activity (e.g., iPad time) can increase engage- ment in an instrumental activity (e.g., work completion) to access the contingent activity. The purpose of the current study was to conduct a systematic replication of Falligant and Rooker The Psychological Record, 71, 307-311, (2021) to further demonstrate the generality and applicability of this approach in clinical contexts. Results of the current study align with prior research demonstrating the ability of the disequilibrium approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of predicted change in instrumental activities based on measures of free operant baseline responding. We discuss study findings from a practical standpoint and offer recommendations for future research on the use of response disequilibrium theory for increas- ing instrumental activities in clinical practice and research.",1,successful,Results of the current study align with prior research demonstrating the ability of the disequilibrium approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of predicted change in instrumental activities based on measures of free operant baseline responding.,abstract,validated - chosen

A key question is whether this overestimation arises solely from body image concerns typical in eating disorders, or if there is an additional perceptual disturbance. To address this question, we applied a two-component model of body size estimation that has been thoroughly replicated in the body image literature concerning healthy individuals. This model shows statistically independent, additive effects on body size estimates of: a) body image concerns, and b) a perceptual component known as contraction bias. Here body image concerns were defined by a principal components analysis (PCA) of psychometric tasks including the: Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Body Shape Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4. The PCA identified three components referred to as PSYCH, FAMPEER, and ATHIN. We investigated the influence of age, personal body mass index (BMI), and these three components on body size estimation in 33 women with a current or past history of eating disorders and 100 healthy controls. Low-BMI control participants overestimated their size, while high-BMI controls underestimated their size, exhibiting the expected normal perceptual contraction bias. However, the women with a history of eating disorders showed no evidence of contraction bias, suggesting a different processing of perceptual aspects of body size estimation compared to controls. We discuss two putative mechanisms that can explain these differences in accuracy of personal body size estimation.",,successful,"Low-BMI control participants overestimated their size, while high-BMI controls underestimated their size, exhibiting the expected normal perceptual contraction bias.

Contrary to our prediction, a high‐powered and pre‐registered 2 (Source: same‐group vs. outgroup) × 2 (Target: ingroup vs. uninvolved outgroup) experiment revealed a classic ISE and an even larger bystander ISE in self‐reports and behaviour, favouring a norm account.

  This study was an approximate replication of Rothman (2011),examining the determiner phrase syntax of a large sample (

The present replication recreated all materials, which were unavailable, and examined the same population and questions.

  We conducted a close replication of the seminal work by Marcus and colleagues from 1999, which showed that after a brief auditory exposure phase, 7‚Äêmonth‚Äêold infants were able to learn and generalize a rule to novel syllables not previously present in the exposure phase. This work became the foundation for the theoretical framework by which we assume that infants are able to learn abstract representations and generalize linguistic rules. While some extensions on the original work have shown evidence of rule learning, the outcomes are mixed, and an exact replication of Marcus et¬†al.'s study has thus far not been reported. A
 recent meta‚Äêanalysis by Rabagliati and colleagues brings to light that the rule‚Äêlearning effect depends on stimulus type (e.g., meaningfulness, speech vs. nonspeech) and is not as robust as often assumed. In light of the theoretical importance of the issue at stake, it is appropriate and necessary to assess the replicability and robustness of Marcus et¬†al.'s findings. Here we have undertaken a replication across four labs with a large sample of 7‚Äêmonth‚Äêold infants (
  N¬†

An increasing number of people watch multiple episodes of their favorite series online, a process often spanning several hours. Granow et al.

Because it is one of the most important studies on the topic, we conducted a direct replication of Granow et al. (2018) . We also extended the original study by including additional variables derived from self-determination theory. We conducted an online questionnaire with 668 respondents. Results showed that we could not reproduce the exact model that was reported. We also needed to adapt several of the originally tested measures to achieve satisfactory model fit. After introducing these changes, results showed that we replicated 67% of all effects in terms of significance (i.e., originally significant effects were also significant in the replication, and vice versa). When looking at effect size (i.e., originally reported effects fell into the replication‚Äôs 95% confidence interval), we replicated 42%. Our study represents a partial replication of Granow et al.

In our extension, we found two further positive links between binge-watching and well-being: Binge-watching was associated not only with greater autonomy, but also with increased feelings of competence and relatedness.

However, the successful replication of recent genome‚Äêwide association findings implicating some regions of chromosome 8q24 in the disparate prostate cancer susceptibility in men of European and African ancestry have been encouraging. This case‚Äìcontrol study was designed to evaluate the association between germline variations in chromosome 8q24 and prostate cancer risk in Afro‚ÄêCaribbean Tobago men, a population of predominantly West African ancestry.METHODSHigh molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from blood clots using Qiagen kits. Genotyping was performed on genomic DNA using a pre‚Äêdesigned TaqMan SNP assay according to the manufacture's protocol on a 7900HT Fast Real‚ÄêTime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).RESULTS
  SNP rs16901979 in region 2 was associated with significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02‚Äì1.95,

Strengthening the consolidation of the fear-inhibitory safety memory formed during extinction is one way to counteract return of fear. In a previous study, we found that post-extinction L-DOPA administration improved extinction memory retrieval 24‚Äâh later. Furthermore, spontaneous post-extinction reactivations of a neural activation pattern evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction predicted extinction memory retrieval, L-DOPA increased the number of these reactivations, and this mediated the effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory retrieval. Here, we conducted a preregistered replication study of this work in healthy male participants. We confirm that spontaneous post-extinction vmPFC reactivations predict extinction memory retrieval. This predictive effect, however, was only observed 90‚Äâmin after extinction, and was not statistically significant at 45‚Äâmin as in the discovery study. In contrast to our previous study, we find no evidence that L-DOPA administration significantly enhances retrieval and that this is mediated by enhancement of the number of vmPFC reactivations. However, additional non-preregistered analyses reveal a beneficial effect of L-DOPA on extinction retrieval when controlling for the trait-like stable baseline levels of salivary alpha-amylase enzymatic activity. Further, trait salivary alpha-amylase negatively predicts retrieval, and this effect is reduced by L-DOPA treatment. Importantly, the latter findings result from non-preregistered analyses and thus further investigation is needed.",1,mixed,"We confirm that spontaneous post-extinction vmPFC reactivations predict

Given the practical and theoretical importance of this finding, the current study aimed to replicate and extend it. Following the original study, we measured heart rate while participants viewed emotional faces (angry, happy, neutral). Extending the original study, we included a baseline measure and performed additional, more fine-grained analyses. Our results support the hypothesis that participants show physiological signs of freezing when looking at angry faces. Importantly, we also find this effect when comparing heart rate in the angry block to baseline levels. Interestingly, the heart rate effects are explained by deceleration in the first 30 s of the 1-min angry block, but not in the second 30 s. Like Roelofs et al., we find evidence that the effects are modulated by state anxiety, but our effects are only marginal and we do not replicate the negative correlation between heart rate and state anxiety in the angry block.

We replicate the difference in age estimates, but find no relationship between participants’ age and their perception of the ambiguous figure. This leads us to conclude that the positive relationship between participants’ age and their age estimates of the ambiguous ‘my wife/mother-in-law’ figure is better explained by the own-age anchor effect, which holds that people use their own age as a yard stick to judge the age of the figure, regardless of whether the young woman or the older lady is perceived.

A leading example is whether subtle linguistic cues embedded in voter mobilization messages dramatically increase turnout. An initial study analyzing two small‐scale field experiments argued that describing someone as a voter (noun) instead of one who votes (verb) increases turnout rates 11 to 14 points because the noun activates a person's social identity as a voter. A subsequent study analyzing a large‐scale field experiment challenged this claim and found no effect. But questions about the initial claim's domain of applicability persist. The subsequent study may not have reproduced the conditions necessary for the psychological phenomenon to occur, specifically the electoral contexts were not competitive or important enough for the social identity to matter. To address the first of these critiques, as well as other potential explanations for different results between the first two studies, we conduct a large‐scale replication field experiment.

bias emerged between anxiety and healthy control groups. While general negative affectivity across the sample
was not associated with attention bias, there was a positive relationship for anxiety and irritability on duration of

Open Research Europe, 4(135), 135.",10.12688/openreseurope.17749.1,"Background
Failures to obtain a desired reward, such as losing money in
gambling, can lead to frustration. In gambling, this frustration has
been shown to take the form of faster responses after losses
compared with wins and non-gambling trials. In addition, reward
omission or blockage can lead to more forceful responses. Yu and
colleagues (2014) showed that the proximity to a reward and the
effort already expended to acquire the reward increased participants’
response force and their retrospective self-reported frustration when
the reward was blocked.
Methods
In this study, we attempted to replicate the findings of Yu and
colleagues (2014) using the same experimental procedure. In each
schedule, participants (N = 32) needed to complete an arrow direction
task for varying numbers of times to win a reward but could be
blocked at any stage. The response time (RT) and force of confirming
the outcomes were used as indicators of ‘frustration’. In addition, to
obtain a more real-time and objective measure of (negative) emotion,
we measured facial electromyographic (EMG) activity over the
corrugator supercilii (frowning muscle) and the zygomaticus (smiling
muscle). Results
Due to technical problems, our data on response force were invalid. In
line with the original study, both goal proximity and exerted effort
increased participants’ self-reported motivation in the task and
frustration after being blocked. An exploratory analysis showed that
participants were slower in confirming an outcome when they were
blocked closer to the reward, while exerted effort did not influence
confirm RT. These RT data were consistent with self-reported surprise
ratings, suggesting an orienting response. In the facial EMG data, we
observed no difference between wins and losses in activity over the
corrugator or the zygomaticus.
Conclusion
Taken together, these data suggest that reward blockage does not
necessarily lead to behavioral or psychophysiological expressions of
negative emotions such as frustration.",1,successful,"In

(approach bias) among healthy participants. A previous study with Virtual Reality (VR) and online motion-
capture quantified this approach bias towards food and non-food cues in a controlled VR environment with

hand movements. The aim of this study was to test the specificity of a manual approach bias for high-calorie food
in grasp movements compared to low-calorie food and neutral objects of different complexity, namely, simple
balls and geometrically more complex office tools.

Methods: In a VR setting, healthy participants (N = 27) repeatedly grasped or pushed high-calorie food, low-
calorie food, balls and office tools in randomized order with 30 item repetitions. All objects were rated for

valence and arousal.
Results: High-calorie food was less attractive and more arousing in subjective ratings than low-calorie food and
neutral objects. Movement onset was faster for high-calorie food in push-trials, but overall push responses were
comparable. In contrast, responses to high-calorie food relative to low-calorie food and to control objects were
faster in grasp trials for later stages of interaction (grasp and collect). Non-parametric tests confirmed an
approach bias for high-calorie food.
Conclusion: A behavioural bias for food was specific to high-calorie food objects. The results confirm the presence
of bottom-up advantages in motor-cognitive behaviour for high-calorie food in a non-clinical population. More
systematic variations of object fidelity and in clinical populations are outstanding. The utility of VR in assessing
approach behaviour is confirmed in this study by exploring manual interactions in a controlled environment.",1,successful,"The results confirm the presence

choice options are relatively easy. When actually experiencing (or predicting affective states for)
only one of these options, people are usually in single evaluation (SE) mode where direct
comparisons are more difficult. This situational difference in evaluation mode was observed to lead
to overpredictions of positive affect (happiness) when people were in JE in comparison to SE for
options that were quantitatively different, but there were no overpredictions for options that were
qualitatively different. This effect was coined distinction bias. In the present paper, we replicated

posing affected levels of hormones such as testosterone

power). We conducted a conceptual replication study

a design in which the experimenter was blind to condi-

the three outcome measures that Carney et al. used, we
also studied two more behavioral tasks (risk taking in the

valence and arousal than familiar, nonnostalgic control songs, and higher in mixed valence in some metrics.
Individuals with higher trait-level Trait Nostalgia reported higher nostalgia ratings across nostalgic and
control songs. Interactions between context- and person-level factors indicated that personality influenced
the felt valence and arousal profile of music-evoked nostalgia, distinct from familiar control music. While
some personality types found nostalgic music to make them feel more aroused and positive (those high in
care, trait nostalgia, anger), others felt more negative while listening (those high in sadness). Last, we
extend the personality profile of a highly nostalgic person; trait-level Trait Nostalgia was associated
with care, play, agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism. We demonstrate affective and person-level

of Study 5 by Anderson, Brion, et al. (2012), which found that individual differences in desire for
status was positively correlated with being overconfident about one’s task performance relative

equivalence testing and Bayesian analysis to test a set of null hypotheses in the original study.
We found support for the status-enhancement hypothesis: Desire for status had a positive
association with overconfidence using both the original measure of desire for status (β = 0.19,
95% [0.09, 0.28]) and the alternative measure (β = 0.31, 95% [0.22, 0.39]). A follow-up
extension study aimed to test this relationship causally by manipulating the social context where
status motives may be stronger (a competitive vs. cooperative context) and testing whether such
an effect is driven by state-level desire for status. We did not find a direct causal effect of social
context on overconfidence, but an indirect association via state-level desire for status: a
competitive (vs. cooperative) group context increased desire for status (β = 0.34, 95% [0.18,

grammatical morphemes for L1 Spanish learners of L2 English. Additionally, the developmental patterns of
individual morphemes will be studied with the help of a tagging method called Interlanguage Annotation. The
study of acquisition order within the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) has been a topic of interest
since the so-called Morpheme Order Studies of the 1970s. The key findings from the studies have suggested that
accuracy scores of the morphemes reflect a somewhat fixed order of morpheme acquisition for L2 English
learners irrespective of L1 background, age, or learning environment. Recent methodological improvements in
the field have been aided by adapting research methods from Learner Corpus Research, which involves the
analysis of language through the use of corpora.
The design for the current study comes from a reference study (Lozano and Díaz-Negrillo 2019) which proposed
two improvements to methods used in acquisition order research. Firstly, the L2 learners in the study were
separated according to their L2 proficiency, a practice that has been overlooked in previous studies. Secondly,
they proposed a fine-grained annotation method called Interlanguage Annotation, which allows for a more
comprehensive analysis of the learner language samples. The current study employs the same design principles
and is a replication of the reference study with a different dataset. The data is in the form of written learner
language samples from 18–20-year-old L1 Spanish university students, who were given a task to summarize the
events of a short clip from a silent film. The language samples have been obtained from COREFL, a learner
corpus of L2 English. Each sample has been annotated separately for all morphemes, and the accuracy scores for
the morphemes have been calculated similarly to the reference study. The results of the study preliminarily
suggest that, unlike the reference study, L2 proficiency level does not have a considerable effect on the
acquisition order of morphemes. Additionally, the use of Interlanguage Annotation helped to uncover some
developmental patterns within individual morphemes, for example that omission errors were the most common
error subtype in 3rd person singular -s.",1,failed,"The results of the study preliminarily

measured with explicit verbal tasks and found to develop slowly during the preschool years.
New implicit ToM measures have lately revolutionized the field by suggesting that ToM may
be present much earlier in development. However, recent replication studies of implicit ToM
present a complex pattern of failed, partial and successful attempts. The big challenge is to
identify an underlying system to this pattern that can explain why some tasks replicate while
others do not. The rationale of the present study was to address this challenge by investigating
one potential factor that may explain patterns of (non-)replications of implicit measures, namely
elements of verbal narration in anticipatory looking tasks. Sixty-seven 4- to 5-year-old children
completed modified versions of two different anticipatory looking implicit false belief tasks
which were originally designed by Southgate et al. (2007) and Surian and Geraci (2012) and
recently proved difficult to replicate. The main modification was that verbal narration was
added to the original stimulus videos. Results revealed that original looking patterns could still
not be replicated. There was no improvement in the Surian and Geraci (2012) task, while a
slight improvement was observed in the Southgate et al. (2012) task. In conclusion, adding
verbal narration does not necessarily improve the replicability of anticipatory ToM tasks,
suggesting either that these measures might not be sufficiently sensitive to tap implicit ToM, or
that other factors are crucial for successful replications.",,failed,Results revealed that original looking patterns could still not be replicated.,abstract,validated - chosen

 19 pandemic. The intervention uses behavioral economics tools to reorient parents’ attention towards positive parenting
 
 
 
 practices. Using an experimental design involving 39 early childhood centers (687 families), we find no effects of the inter-
 
 vention on the outcomes of interest. This finding contrasts with those found in a previous edition of the program in 2018,

 of results, which in turn point to key issues to consider when designing similar programs. First, these messaging programs
 
 may work as a complement to more intensive interventions, but may have limited impact when implemented in isolation.
 
 Unlike the 2018 messages, which were sent after an 8-session face-to-face workshop, the new edition was implemented
 
 without a previous workshop. Second, the problems introduced by the pandemic increased families’ stress, time and space
 
 constraints, potentially reducing family’s receptivity to the messages. Indeed, we find suggestive evidence that the messages
 
 increased parental stress or depressive symptoms in adults facing household overcrowding. In addition, early childhood
 
 centers actively used WhatsApp messages to stay in touch with families during the pandemic, competing for the attention
 
 of the families. Finally, the 2020 sample had a higher prevalence of more educated mothers, who may be less responsive to
 
 these types of interventions.",,failed,"we find no effects of the intervention on the outcomes of interest.

The previous study hypothesized that watching an awe-inducing video would lead participants to write fewer strengths before writing their weaknesses. In addition to the replication, we hypothesized that participants with higher scores of depressive symptomatology (DS) would list fewer strengths due to diminished self-concept and self-efficacy. Ninety-four undergraduate psychology students were recruited from McGill University ranging from 18 to 35 years of age. Participants were randomly assigned to either the awe-inducing or neutral video condition, and then filled out measures of humility, emotional reactions, and DS. In contradiction with the original study, participants in the awe condition and the neutral condition did not significantly differ in their ratio of disclosed strengths to weaknesses, therefore no significant correlations were found between awe and humility or humility and depression. Additionally, results indicated that participants with greater DS did not list fewer strengths compared to those scoring lower on the CES-D. We were unable to directly replicate the original study and thus rejected our alternate hypothesis. This study had various potential limitations, among which are the possibilities of self-report bias, issues regarding convenience sampling, and bias due to time constraints. The current study advances the literature by including depression relating to awe and humility. Further research is needed, to differentiate lab-induced awe from natural experiences of awe and identify possible moderating factors on humility.",1,failed,"In contradiction with the original study, participants in the awe condition and the neutral condition did not

behavioral cues (word count, tentative words, upper face surprise, lower face happiness) could accurately
discriminate deceptive murderers from genuinely distressed individuals, pleading for the return of a missing
relative. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that each of the four behavioral cues identified in the original study
would be similarly related (i.e., size, direction, significance) to veracity in a novel set of pleaders. With these
cues as predictors, we also hypothesized that logistic regression models—separately testing the original and
replication samples—would produce similar accuracy rates exceeding chance in discriminating genuine
from deceptive pleaders. Method: We gathered a new sample of public appeals, including 82 genuine and
14 deceptive pleaders. After establishing ground truth, we transcribed video-recorded pleas and coded them
for the presence of upper face surprise and lower face happiness. We used Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count to determine word count and the proportion of tentative words in each appeal. Results: We found
support for several hypotheses. Tentative words were used significantly more by deceptive (vs. genuine)
pleaders in both the original and replication samples. Deceptive pleaders used significantly fewer words in
both samples, although this relationship was significant only in the original sample. Liars in both samples
smiled more than truth-tellers, although this relationship was statistically significant only in the replication
sample. However, predictive accuracy was poor and did not differ from chance in the replication sample.
Conclusions: Findings do not provide a tidy picture of the reliability of behavioral cues to deception.
Although some behavioral cues did replicate across samples, others did not. More research will be necessary
to understand the factors that produce variable findings across samples, despite using the same methods of
investigation.",,mixed,"Findings do not provide a tidy picture of the reliability of behavioral cues to deception. Although some behavioral cues did replicate across samples, others did not.",abstract,awaiting validation

a win on the first card (for all participants) and either a regular loss or a near-miss in the

effects (original: f = 0.35, 95% CI [0.09, 0.61]; replication: f = 0.10, 95% CI [0.03, 0.16]). Also, similar to

the original, we found that participants tended to attribute a favorable ratio of positive traits when mak-
ing self-assessments (original: f = 0.77, 95% CI [0.29, 1.25]; replication: f = 0.88, 95% CI [0.50, 1.26]).

However, unlike the original, we failed to find support for the core hypothesis that participants would
ascribe more dispositional traits to their temporally distant self compared to their present self (original:
f = 0.54, 95% CI [0.27, 0.77]; replication: f = 0.02, 95% CI [0.00, 0.06]). Furthermore, in contrast to
the original, we found that the positive traits ratio increases with temporal distance (original: f = 0.16,
95% CI [0.00, 0.36]; replication: f = 0.33, 95% CI [0.22, 0.42] in the opposite direction). Contrary to our
hypothesis, in an extension, we found that people were more likely to ascribe a greater ratio of positive
traits to their friends than to themselves (ξ = 0.3, 95% CI [0.21, 0.38]). All materials, data, and code are

The identified victim effect is the phenomenon in which people tend to contribute more to identified than to
unidentified victims. Kogut and Ritov (Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 18(3), 157–167, 2005) found that
the identified victim effect was limited to a single victim and driven by empathic emotions. In a pre-registered
experiment with an online U.S. American MTurk sample on CloudResearch (N = 2003), we conducted a close
replication and extension of Experiment 2 from Kogut and Ritov (Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 18(3),
157–167, 2005). The replication findings failed to provide empirical support for the identified single victim
effect hypothesis since we found no evidence of differences in willingness to contribute when comparing a
single identified victim to a single unidentified victim (η2

seminal demonstration of the identifiable victim effect, with hypothetical donations. We

directly informing participants of the effect (Study 1) and by providing an identified
victim with statistical information (Study 3). We found no empirical support for the
identifiable victim effect ( = .000, 95% CI [.000, .003]) and subsequently no support for
debiasing such a phenomenon ( = .001, 95% CI[.000, .012]). These findings suggest that
the identifiable victim may be better framed in terms of ‘scope-insensitivity’. In other
words, rather than providing more to a single identified victim, participants seem to be
insensitive to the number of victims affected. However, our study involved only
hypothetical donations rather than a real-effort real-donation paradigm as in Small et al.

Taking the above, we found empirical support for Gray et al.’s ‘body focus inducing redistribution of mind perception’ effect and the ‘body focus inferring different moral statuses’ effect. Extending the replication, we failed to find support for a lower perceived moral praiseworthiness or a higher perceived capacity to feel pleasure with increased body focus. However, we found support for a higher attribution of moral blameworthiness than moral praiseworthiness, a positive association between perceived moral blameworthiness and perceived free will, and increased perceived agency and experience with mind focus.

intentions induce more lenient wrongness judgements for accidentals, and weak empirical support

a significantly larger extent for harm violations compared to purity violations. However, pattern (1)
was not specific to moral judgements versus disgust ratings; and pattern (2) was not specific to moral
judgements versus emotion ratings. Extending the replication, the mean difference in moral
responsibility judgements between harm and purity violation for accidentals (d = -0.32, 95% CI [-
